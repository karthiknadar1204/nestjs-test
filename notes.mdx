in nestjs project,each module is a compilation of folders mainly :
- middleware
- routes
- controllers
- services
so if we have a user module,all user related endpoints will be under the user module following the above structure.
refer to struct.png for more details.

in app.service.ts,we define the business logic for the app. the @injectable decorator is used to inject the service into the controller.
in app.controller.ts,we define the endpoints for the app. the @controller decorator is used to define the controller and the @get decorator is used to define the endpoint.
in app.module.ts,we define the modules for the app. the @module decorator is used to define the module and the @imports decorator is used to import the modules.
in main.ts,we bootstrap the app. the @nestfactory.create is used to create the app.


to create a module using cli,use the following command:
nest g module <module-name>

any new module created gets registered in the app.module.ts file,app.module.ts is the root module of the app.


TO create a controller using cli,use the following command:
nest g controller <controller-name>
-> we need to have a module first to create a controller.
@Controller('auth') basically means that /auth is the base url for all the endpoints in the controller.

to create a service using cli,use the following command:
nest g service/s <service-name>

to create a pipe using cli,use the following command:
nest g pipe <pipe-name>

to create a guard using cli,use the following command:
nest g guard <guard-name>
-> we need to have a module first to create a guard.
